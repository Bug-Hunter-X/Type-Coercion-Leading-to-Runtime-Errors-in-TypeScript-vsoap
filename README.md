This repository demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to unexpected runtime errors. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers but the code calls it with a string and a number. TypeScript doesn't catch this because of its type coercion rules.  The solution shows how to prevent this with stricter type checking.
